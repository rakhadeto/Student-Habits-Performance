## 📌 Project Overview

This project applies **Descriptive Analytics** to explore the relationship between student lifestyle habits and academic performance. Using a dataset of **1,000 students** with **16 variables**, this analysis answers:

> *"What daily habits and personal factors are most associated with higher exam scores?"*

**Analytics Type Used: Descriptive Analytics**
Descriptive analytics summarizes historical data to reveal patterns, trends, and distributions — answering the question **"What happened?"** It is the foundation of data-driven decision-making and the first step before applying diagnostic, predictive, or prescriptive analytics.

## 📊 Key Findings

### 🔑 1. Study Hours is the Dominant Factor (r = 0.825)

<p align="center">
  <img src="visualizations/chart2_scatter.png" width="75%"/>
</p>

Study hours per day has a **very strong positive correlation (r = 0.825)** with exam score — by far the highest among all variables. Students who study 6+ hours/day consistently score above 80.

## 💡 Analytical Approach

This project uses **Descriptive Analytics**, which:
- Summarizes historical data using statistical measures (mean, median, std dev, percentages)
- Identifies patterns and correlations between variables
- Presents findings through informative visualizations
- Does **not** predict future outcomes (that would be Predictive Analytics)
- Does **not** explain root causes (that would be Diagnostic Analytics)

---

## ❓ Q&A Section

### Q1: Why is it important to identify the question before beginning the project?

Defining a clear analytical question before starting is critical because it:
- **Focuses the analysis** — prevents wasting time on irrelevant data explorations
- **Guides method selection** — the question determines which analytics type (descriptive, diagnostic, predictive, prescriptive) is appropriate
- **Saves resources** — avoids collecting/cleaning data that won't be used
- **Enables measurement of success** — you know when the analysis is "done"
- **Improves communication** — stakeholders understand the output when it directly answers a stated question

In this project, the guiding question was: *"What habits are most associated with higher exam scores?"* — which directed every analytical and visualization decision.

### Q2: Sources of Open Data for Analysis

The dataset for this project was downloaded from **[Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com)**.

Other notable open data sources include:
